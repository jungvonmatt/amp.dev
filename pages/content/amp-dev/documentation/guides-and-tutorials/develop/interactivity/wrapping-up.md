Congratulations! You just created an interactive e-commerce product detail page with variable sizes and prices for each SKU, fetched on-demand from a remote JSON endpoint.

You learned how to:

- Use [`<amp-state>`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}#state) to fetch product information (color, size, availability).
- Use [`amp-bind`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}) to create cross-element interactions.
- Create a fast and rich user experience with AMP!

If you got stuck, see the [`static/final.html`](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/advanced-interactivity-in-amp/blob/master/static/final.html) file for the complete solution.

## Next steps

Learn more about the power and flexibility of building interactive AMP pages in the  [`amp-bind`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}) documentation and from other [dynamic AMP components]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/index.html', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}).
