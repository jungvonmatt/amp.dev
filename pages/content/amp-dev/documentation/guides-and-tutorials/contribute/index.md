The AMP Project would not be possible without help from all members of the community
whether you are a developer, content creator or provider of services relevant to AMP.
There are many ways for you to contribute.

### Reporting issues with AMP
If you have feedback or are experiencing technical issues with AMP, please file it using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues).  If you're having issues with [ampproject.org](https://ampproject.org), please use the [docs issue tracker](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/issues) instead.

### Providing technical contributions to AMP

The AMP Project strongly encourages technical contributions!

We hope you'll become an ongoing participant in our open source community, but we also welcome one-off contributions for the issues you're particularly passionate about.

#### Helping with code

To get started with contributing code to the AMP Project read through [the CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), which includes details of the process by which a feature or bug fix goes from concept to submission and how you can participate in technical designs and discussions.  If you're new to open source we have some [tips for getting started](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code).

#### Helping with documentation

Documentation is important for the entire AMP community, and we would appreciate your help in making our documentation better!  We've got all sorts of documentation--examples for users of AMP, docs to help AMP Project contributors, etc.

[ampproject.org](https://ampproject.org) is where most people get familiar with AMP.  You can contribute to documentation in the [ampproject docs GitHub project](https://github.com/ampproject/docs).  (You can even make [the page you are reading](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/blob/master/content/docs/contribute/contribute.md) better!)

[ampbyexample.com]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/examples/index.html', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}) provides examples of how to use AMP.  You can improve it at the [amp-by-example GitHub project](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-by-example/).

You can also help make things better for other contributors to the AMP Project by improving our documentation in the [amphtml GitHub project](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml).

#### Helping with translations
AMP strives to make the world wide web a better experience for everyone. To enable everyone in the world to use AMP, we need translation contributors for guides, tutorials, blogs and all things written for AMP. To get involved with localizing AMP documentation for your community, check out the [AMP Translation Initiative](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/blob/master/TRANSLATIONS.md).
