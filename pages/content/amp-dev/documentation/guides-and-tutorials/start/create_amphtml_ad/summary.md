You've successfully created an AMPHTML ad that can be served on AMP and non-AMP pages! 

In this tutorial, you learned to:

* Create a valid AMPHTML ad according to the [AMPHTML ad spec]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/a4a_spec.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}})
* Track ad views by using the [`amp-pixel`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-pixel.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}) component
* Verify the AMPHTML ad syntax by using the [AMP validator](https://validator.ampproject.org/#htmlFormat=AMP4ADS)

## Next steps

You just learned how to create a basic image ad, but there are many more formats that you can use for AMPHTML ads. Visit [AMP By Example]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/examples/index.html', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}), which provides advanced AMPHTML ad templates, like lightbox ads, carousel ads, video ads, slide ads, and more.
