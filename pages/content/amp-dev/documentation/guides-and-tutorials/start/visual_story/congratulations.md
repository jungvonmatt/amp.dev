You have successfully completed your first AMP story!

In this tutorial, you learned to:

- Create a multi-page story by using the [`amp-story`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}) component
- Create visual effects with multiple layers in a page
- Lay out elements in a page by using layer templates
- Add audio that plays while a page is viewed
- Animate elements on a page
- Keep readers engaged with your content by adding related links to the end of the story

## Next steps

- [`amp-story`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}})
